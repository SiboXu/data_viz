### Data description:

- According to NASA, the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) instruments on GOES weather satellites was able to detect fireballs and bolides. The data was about the date and time of each reported fireball event.

### Data source: [NASA JPL Center for Near Earth Object Studies](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/)

### Data visualization overview:

- The map will tell viewers how those fireball events located all over the world. Meanwhile, there are year of peak brightness and velocity	information for each event included in the map.
- By looking at the garphs/charts at the bottom of the dashboards, four sets of relationships among fireballs' attributes could be demonstrated.
